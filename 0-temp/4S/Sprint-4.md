= Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset = 

By the end of this exercise, you will have:
  Describe how neuroplasticity is relevant to learning

1. Research Neuroplasticity

  - Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.

    Helps us by breaking the stigma of "you are what you are", and opens new possibilities of "you can become what you want".
    Just by letting us know that is possible to change our brains and it is not previously limited this makes a change in how we take challenges ahead, motivation increases and struggle seems more worth by thinking this is making me better instead of this is just to hard for me or I am not amde for this.

    Like going to the gym I guess and taking heavier loads you have a mindset of this is heavy but will become lighter the more times I lift it (with time of course, short term you just get fatigue), this opens the road of improvement.)


  - Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.

    Well knowing Im not to old to keep changing my brain feels great!
    I try to compare it with exercising in the gym, kind of like well it is hard right now but will be easier later and will bring results, just need to keep at it, eat good rest good and its game.

  - What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?

    Personally I use music and visual cues.
    I lsiten to music to help me focus, since I get distracted quite easy, I use music with no lyrics mainly (currently diving a lot into binaural music, around 40Hz)

    Other one was exercise, used to be constant and liking it (thats why I use it as analogies a lot too), but I have a couple injuries recently and had to step back from the excercise for the last months, really keen on going back tho!

    I do notice the good effects it has on my mind and body, I get better sleep when I go to bed tired, plus overal "good" feeling thanks to endorphins, and well the sauna session after to relax was nothing to complain about.

    I know there are some food that helps with this too like Lion's mane mushroom ( I have tried before, havent noticed the changes like with exercise or music tho).

  - Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

    - Binaural music:
      https://www.healthline.com/health/binaural-beats#instructions

    - Nootropics (Braintropic):
      This is a page that provides information about Nootropics in general, its like suplements but specially defined by the effects that they have on the brain (instead of the commonly used for other parts of the body organs etc.. Really interesting!)
      https://www.braintropic.com/

    - Lights!
      https://ledlightinginfo.com/what-color-led-light-is-best-for-studying#:~:text=Cool%20light%20colors%20%E2%80%93%20blues%20and,most%20attentive%20as%20you%20study.

      I knew about the effect of light in humans for other things like waking up(btw its blue too), so this make thing about if they where colors that favors, focus, attention and study in general.
      Will give this ones a try since I was already using them in other areas of my life.

    - Atomic Habits!
      https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits
      I got this as an audio book, and started listening to it on my commuting, really put some things in perspective, just like mindset we can mold and work on every aspect on ourselves I believe, so now a I am working on becoming who I want to be step by step.

  - Describe what Growth Mindset is and why it is important
    
    Is a mindset where people believe that their abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.

    I think is important as a motivator fact, making you believe that everyday you are in a possition of improvement, you can always become smarter, and better, there is always room for improvement.

    Also knowing this, makes it a double edge sword, in my case I knew about this before but this also means that you brain can(and will) deteriorate when not used (just like muscles and going to gym again! :p) so its not only to become smarter is to mantain you there.
    Thats when we fall back to habits, and its currently what I am working on as well, still baby steps!!

    

2. Research Growth Mindset

  - Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
    
    Growth Mindset is the state when you have embraced that you are able to improve tour brain capabilities by hard work, study and practice, insted aof being on a fixed minset of I am as smart as I was born and my habilities are limited by this.

    It is important since we need to believe we are able to do something in order to do it, knowing that we can still imrpove and lear removes that mind limiter we tend to put on ourselves.

  - In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

    Not personally, I have always been taught this way I suppose, just never actually investigated about it, but always believed that I am able to improve and to deteroriate as well.
    (but lest keep a bright approach and focus on improving for now, and always)

  - How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

    Searching for best practices first I am not trying to re-invent the wheel here, use what it is already defined and out, then trying it on me see how that affects me and how I feel, stickuing with what brought the bets results, imrpoving then maybe trying again some of the other stuff 

  - Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

    I linked everything in the Neuroplasticity one give it a check!

3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies

  This makes me take more seriously this whole area of studying, I have always believed it, but now I think I havent prioritized it as much as I should have, will have to re-evaluate my times and make sure to add more times for reflection since its is when thing kind of ground into your brain (thats the closest feeling explanation I feel when doing it)

= Cultural Blog - Mindset =

By the end of this exercise, you will have:
  Discussed your understanding of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning
  Published that discussion as a personal blog

1. Create a file named neuroplasticity.html and add your discussions and insights to it.

1. What code readability is.
2. Why it's an important skill to have as a developer.
3. What code readability habits you can start building on today.

=JavaScript Methods=

  1. How to research a new concept.

    - Stack Overflow is "a question and answer website for professional and enthusiastic programmers".
    - Helpful articles can be found on both freeCodeCamp and Medium (on Medium this can take a bit of digging).
    - w3Schools has beginner-friendly explanations of how things work (but sometimes the JS examples aren't great).
    - MDN Web Docs has good, extensive examples, but the comprehensive documentation can sometimes seem challenging when you're a beginner.

    ----------Excercise ------
    
  2. What a method is.
      In JS is a function built into data types - (A pre-saved function we can access when we need it.)

  3. At least two methods.
        done.... kind of

<!--* = Pseudocode = -->

Why problem-solving is an important skill to have as a developer.
A variety of problem-solving techniques you can use today (starting with pseudocode)

Research: 
  Rubber Duck Debugging
    Should explain the program line-by-line to a rubber duck.
    The act of explaining the problem step by step will cause the solution to present itself.

Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

1. were blocked on a simple problem.
  - What was the problem? 
  - What problem-solving techniques did you use?
  - How did you feel throughout the process?
  - What did you learn?

2. elegantly solved a problem.
  - What was the problem?
  - What problem-solving techniques did you use?
  - How did you feel throughout the process?
  - What did you learn?


Reflect on:

Pseudocode - Yup do it

Trying something - No other way to start

Rubber ducky method - console.log

Reading error messages - first step to solve a problem

Console.logging - for me this is the duck method

Googling - right after rememering fails

Asking your peers for help - 
I have asked when I feel is important or might push me back too much(like when I was struggling with setup), but in these scenarios where I still got some time and I know the answer is there im just not able to reach it yet, I just like the challenge and to stuggle with it till it cracks hehe, but I do understand the importance of asking for a hand when it really needed, Im sure I will be there soon too xD

Asking coaches for help

Improving your process with reflection
Some of these I see the benefit of them right away(like analogies with concepts and making stories of thing interact with each other), some others not that much but I still believe that is for my own good and maybe I just need to do it to relize about the benefits later on, we will see.
