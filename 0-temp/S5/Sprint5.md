What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
1. That I am indeed able to reach my goals if I put my mind into it.

2. The importance of a good mentality (possitive toughts) 
Also I worked it like killing ANTS (killing automatic negative toughts)

3. The massive effect that planning ahead has for your day, set your days for success, sleep better, times for breaks and times to grind, this really made a difference

Q What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?

You never stop learning.
To code for you and others (think about who will see the code afterwards)
and that we are on the same team.

Q What has surprised you the most about the core learning?

A
The importance that was given by this school, I like it actually and want to keep getting involved even thouugh it does makes me  get out of my confort zone most times.

Q What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?

A For me is publishing these reflections as I mentioned befre I dont mind doeing these but I am not a big fan of putting them out for others to see and sometimes that also keeps me from going all out, its ok in a way because thanks to that I started Journaling too, and there I feel a bit more secure since It only for myself.

Q - Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?

A.
My guess is that the enviroment must been affected, normally people dont try to fix a problem if there is not one, so there must be some sort of issue with the attitude and enviroment in the laboral force at the moment since they are working this hard into improving it.

Q. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?

A . Not a waste at all, in fact it has been really beneficial for me personally.
But it does stress me a bit on top of the learning coding part, still I do see the benefits and how will this affect my development as a developer, so I am happy to get good metrics from the begining and set the pace like this, still not my forte but we become better at everything we keep practicicng.


Q Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

A. Not at all, I made most of my progress when having good mentality and I believe opening this chanels for yourself kind of opens door inside yoursefl so you can become a better version of yourself.
The times that I tried to force myself to finish and learn was the times I believe I ended wasting my time.
Also I suposso this answe chnages for everyone, in my case I was needing more of core help than technical at least for the begining and setting the pace.
