<!--? CSS CHANGES ---------------- -->

Create a general is-text class
formatting all text that is not titles
add sub classes (just a second class)

for specific changes if I want differences in text for tech, core, post etc
to use a system of classes:
is-text
tech-text
blog-entry-text
question-text
answer-text

just something like that 


<!-- ^ TECH.HTML OBSERVATIONS -->

Tech.html
  - dead link to About   

class: "sprints-main" + "tech-content" prob only need 1
  check on: div class: "tech-content" on tech

check if possible to change classes: 

"tech-blog-image" for a generalized "is-image" + "modifier"

check div class: "sprint-topic-content"  is it a wrapper?
if not tyr to change it for section "is-text" + "modifiers"

- change div.tech-blog-entry 
for button to see full blog entry













Not so important:


- all my spans are default bold, make a class and wrap them accordingly
