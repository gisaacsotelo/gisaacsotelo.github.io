Tech.html
  - dead link to About   


  class: "sprints-main"
  used in tech.html 

  check on - div class: "tech-content" on tech

Create a general is-text class
formatting all text that is not titles
add sub classes (just a second class)

for specific changes if I want differences in text for tech, core, post etc
to use a system of classes:
is-text
tech-text
blog-entry-text
question-text
answer-text

just something like that
