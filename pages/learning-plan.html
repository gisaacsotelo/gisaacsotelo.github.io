          <br>Once in the zone I can push through
          <br>I love to learn new things
          <br>I'm good at fixing things (more a devoleper of existing things, than a creating from 
          scratch)
          <br>Team player (Like to see the strenghts and what everyone bring to the table, 
          two heads work better than one)

          <span>Concerns:</span>
          <br>My attention span is not the greatest, won't even call it good these days.
          <br>Time management
          <br>Asking for help (Not afraid to do so, but I enjoy the challenge and like to find the 
          answers on my own, tend to learn a lot of other things while searching for one answer).
          <br>Procrastinator lvl.100
          <br>Inperfect perfectionist. (I dont believe in perfection, but tend to spend over time 
          streamlining things that are not required at that point).

          This one is still hard for me, Im doing some changes at home, setting specific spaces 
          for specific achievements (Reading atomic habits, I recommed this so much, trying to 
          start applying this).
          <br>Being that said I commit to ask for help if I see that im drifting away from the 
          pack, my goals or my time tables (Im still allowing myself some time to drift here, just 
          working in reducing it little by little).

          I expect support when asked for it, havent been asking for much now, but I feel that will

            I think the pace of work will increase and will be harder, so that is the reason 
            we have been groomed for this during these foundation weeks.
            <br>So I expect to be up to the challenge nad do my best with a good mentality not bringing 
            myself down.
            <br>Would like to reach the point that I can stop worrying about myself so I can actually 
            help others too.
