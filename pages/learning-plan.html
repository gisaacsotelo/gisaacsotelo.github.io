        <p>I want to gather the knowledge and abilities required to become a web developer and start a career in the tech sector, then start walking the walk a step at a time.

        <p><span>Strenghts:</span>
          <br>Once in the zone I can push through
          <br>I love to learn new things
          <br>I'm good at fixing things (more a devoleper of existing things, than a creating from scratch)
          <br>Team player (Like to see the strenghts and what everyone bring to the table, two heads work better than one)
        </p><br>
        <p><span>Concerns:</span>
          <br>My attention span is not the greatest, won't even call it good these days.
          <br>Time management
          <br>Asking for help (Not afraid to do so, but I enjoy the challenge and like to find the answers on my own, tend to learn a lot of other things while searching for one answer).
          <br>Procrastinator lvl.100
          <br>Inperfect perfectionist. (I dont believe in perfection, but tend to spend over time streamlining things that are not required at that point).

        <p>Good mentallity.
          <br>Reduce anxiety.
          <br>Separating the problems in smaller ones and tackling them to achieve the goal. (working on this but I see the light and getting slowly into that mindset)
          <br>Keeping my mind in the present task.

        <p>Take a break.
          <br>Think in the nearest problem in hand (the one I can resolve).
          <br>work in that one, re-evaluate the problems, tackle the next one.
          <br>Take a step back and try to see the bigger picture, how everything connects.
          <br>Put things in perpective
          <br>Try again!

        <p>This one is still hard for me, Im doing some changes at home, setting specific spaces for specific achievements (Reading atomic habits, I recommed this so much, trying to start applying this).
        <br>Being that said I commit to ask for help if I see that im drifting away from the pack, my goals or my time tables (Im still allowing myself some time to drift here, just working in reducing it little by little).

        <p>I expect support when asked for it, havent been asking for much now, but I feel that will have to get more in touch now that I am seeing how the sprints and work-flow works during the foundations
        <br><br><span>UPDATE:</span> I have got in touch with my facilitator and open a comunication channel, started showing some of my concerns.

        <p>I currently need this coming week to set things in order (currently many changes in the house, expecting to get thing more structured with proper times by the end of this sprint 3 week).
        <br>Working on noticing my current habbits, and starting a more structured approach to this.
        <br>Atomic Habits!
