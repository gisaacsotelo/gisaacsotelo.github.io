            sleep better, times for breaks and times to grind, this really made a difference

            The importance that was given by this school, I like it actually and want to keep getting 
            involved even thouugh it does makes me  get out of my confort zone most times.

            For me is publishing these reflections as I mentioned befre I dont mind doeing these 
            but I am not a big fan of putting them out for others to see and sometimes that also keeps 
            me from going all out, its ok in a way because thanks to that I started Journaling too, 
            and there I feel a bit more secure since It only for myself.

            My guess is that the enviroment must been affected, normally people dont try to fix a problem 
            if there is not one, so there must be some sort of issue with the attitude and enviroment in 
            the laboral force at the moment since they are working this hard into improving it.

            Not a waste at all, in fact it has been really beneficial for me personally.
            <br>But it does stress me a bit on top of the learning coding part, still I do see 
            the benefits and how will this affect my development as a developer, so I am happy to 
            get good metrics from the begining and set the pace like this, still not my forte but 
            we become better at everything we keep practicicng.

            Not at all, I made most of my progress when having good mentality and I believe opening this chanels 
            for yourself kind of opens door inside yoursefl so you can become a better version of yourself.
            <br>The times that I tried to force myself to finish and learn was the times I believe I ended 
            wasting my time.
            <br>Also I suposso this answe chnages for everyone, in my case I was needing more of core help than 
            technical at least for the begining and setting the pace.
