        <p>My older sister, shes is like super smart, she has been top of the class since she stepped into classrooms....all the way till master's degree, so yeah it's hard to compete with that.
          She told me after years during uni (I had a couple stuggle stages there, tried to change careers a couple times), she was telling me how frustrated she was with me, she says Im the smart one, but I tend to loose interest, she told me in short: "You are not lazy, just undecided, every time I have heard you say you will do something you want to do you have done it". 
          We chatted she let me know things I didn't realized baout myself that they where there but just never noticed them before.</p>

  QUALITY: Do the things properly or dont do them at all (Dad) - this is to be taken not literally, or you end up doing nothing, he meant the value of your work is given by you, dont do half efforts and put your name on them or that will be the value of your name.<br>
  KINDNESS/EMPATHY: The value of a person shows from how they treat the ones that cannot do or offer anythign to them.<br>
  INTEGRITY: I am my parents son, and the embassador of their education.<br>
  COMMUNITY: No one exists by themselves, no one is self-made, we are all part of the same.<br>
  GROWTH: Be a little better than yesterday, and you will never stop moving forward (bad days, weeks, months are allowed, just understand they dont define you be better tomorrow 1% improvements).<br>

        <p>Situation: I was a kid around 11ish, I was in a water park with my family and some cousins, suddenly my sister finds some money under the water, bit or merky water so we where unable to see the bottom of it, I decided to get my googles and went for the hunt!, this ended up in me finding a lot of money around 5k Mexcian pesos (thats around 3.2 life fourtnes when you are 11).
          <br>I told my dad about this massive pack of money i gather bill by bill alongside with some hotel card and and a some keys (No IDs or anything to help know who the owner was)
          <br>My dad after seeing the amount told me to not give it back to the park authorities (Well this is Mexico, he told me they would just take it a dont give it to the owner), then he send me on the mission of finding someone that looks worried sick, and ask him about what was he was looking for, after a few hours I find the guy it was obviously him, just as dad said he lookes worried sick, and checking everywhere I went to ask him about what was he looking for, then he told me about the lost money and I said I only find 200 pesos instead of 5k, he just ignored me after.
          <br>My cousins where telling me to dont go and tell my dad about him that way I was going top be able to keep all that money, and buy a skateboard (I really wanted a sakteboard I remember that clearly).
          <br>At the end I went to my dad told him I found, the guy, we spoke with him asked a few questions (like which hotel was he staying and the amount he loose, dad just make sure he was the owner), then we gave it back, the guy was so happy jumping he even hugged me and thanks me so much for that.
          <br>My cosuing made fun of me for ages after that saying that I was just dumb.
          <br>
          <br>I never regreted that decision, it really marked me and believe is one of the key experiences that made me who I am and what kinda of man my father was too, till this day my cousins remember that story and still think that was really dumb.

        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>

      <div class="sprint-topic-content">
        <p>A bit mixed with the past story, we have lots of saying back home, and well lots of corruption as I imagine everyone knows.
          <br>One of the most common sayings says: "El que no tranza, no avanza" (meaning the ones who doesnt cheat doesnt move forward), believe or not I do feel most of the people in the country lives by this rule, and took me years honestly years, to understand the values that my parents where trying to get on me.
          <br>No one looks after the good guy, at least not in my country for what I can remmeber, its quite sad sometimes.
          <br>
          <br>It was until I was working here in New zealand on my first year where I realized the weight on those values I was taught, here people was just different, dont want to say better since it is not in me to decide that, there is great people everywhere, but it was till here when it finally clicked.
          <br> A part of me honestly believes that my parents groomed me to go away of the country.
          <br>
          <br>I feel my culture showed me both sides of the coin, there are many, many thing I miss from back home, things that I honestly see as better from back home, but also lots and lots thta just feel better here, I believe is about of getting the good from where you find it and keep that and teach that, use the bad experiences to grow and learn.

        <p>Working hospitality, kitchen job, I was the sous-chef at the time (2nd in command), and the head chef was off, so yeah I was in command for the night.
          <br>Thing where not going great that night one of my chefs was just not in the mood really "stinking" the mood around others too, like if he was not happy and dint want anyone to be happy for whatever reason.
          <br>I tried to give him some time first, nothing changed, tried to reach, offered him a drink, a coffe still strinking the mood, he went to the bacl kitchen and I follow shortly.
          <br>We just have a brief chat, I told him if he was ok, that he is not normally behaving like this, and if everything was ok outside work, he was just not in the mood for that aproach either, I gave him some space again.
          <br>I just heard some noises back and he was screaming to our dishy in a way that was just not ok.
          <br>Immediatly told him to get out and take 10, no questions asked, he was not allowed back if 10 min havent passes, meanwhile I spoke with the dishy.
          <br>Also that gave me time to think since I know that confronting anger with anger never works.
          <br>Ended up joining after 10 outside asked the gusy to cover for us and call us if needed, I just sat with him and smoke a cigarrete really calmed, and told him "It really sucks when you dont want to be around you right?"
          <br>He seems to be feeling that way, and just told him about my experiences with feeling like that and how just never helps, you just end up feeling worst after making even your friends get into your "shitty" mood.
          <br>I told him that no one inside is mad with him (because no one was tbh), and just try to make him understand that he is allow to have shitty days, as we all are, but he needed to respect other and their space too.
          <br>After that I told him that he could go home early if he needed, he ended up staying the whole night and slowly became himself again, we just had a good night again.
          <br>After the shift it ended up being problems back home, we just had a drink and a chat, we really become like big families when doing that kind of a job, you fight you hate but at the end they are your tema, and mostly all the people I have worked with have been great.</p>

        <p>
          I believe I have ADHD would love to know more and be diagnosed, have tried methods that really help, but its hard sometimes, also its hard to get the help required here, have tried going and asked my GP, but the system works really slow if its not like health risking situations, just struggle, but I'll get there.
  I mostly learn by doing, what you dont practice you forget.
  I tend to get bored of things and move on to the next one, normally after reaching the goal I wanted.
