            Helps us by breaking the stigma of "you are what you are", and opens new possibilities of "you can become what you want".
            <br>
            <br>Just by letting us know that is possible to change our brains and it is not previously limited this makes a change in how we take challenges ahead, motivation increases and struggle seems more worth by thinking this is making me better instead of this is just to hard for me or I am not amde for this.
            <br>
            <br>Like going to the gym I guess and taking heavier loads you have a mindset of this is heavy but will become lighter the more times I lift it (with time of course, short term you just get fatigue), this opens the road of improvement.)

            Well knowing Im not to old to keep changing my brain feels great!
    I try to compare it with exercising in the gym, kind of like well it is hard right now but will be easier later and will bring results, just need to keep at it, eat good rest good and its game.

            Personally I use music and visual cues.
            <br>I lsiten to music to help me focus, since I get distracted quite easy, I use music with no lyrics mainly (currently diving a lot into binaural music, around 40Hz)
            <br>
            <br>Other one was exercise, used to be constant and liking it (thats why I use it as analogies a lot too), but I have a couple injuries recently and had to step back from the excercise for the last months, really keen on going back tho!
            <br>
            <br>I do notice the good effects it has on my mind and body, I get better sleep when I go to bed tired, plus overal "good" feeling thanks to endorphins, and well the sauna session after to relax was nothing to complain about.
            <br>
            <br>I know there are some food that helps with this too like Lion's mane mushroom ( I have tried before, havent noticed the changes like with exercise or music tho).

            <br>I knew about the effect of light in humans for other things like waking up(btw its blue too), so this make thing about if they where colors that favors, focus, attention and study in general.

            Is a mindset where people believe that their abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
            <br>
            <br>I think is important as a motivator fact, making you believe that everyday you are in a possition of improvement, you can always become smarter, and better, there is always room for improvement.
            <br>
            <br>Also knowing this, makes it a double edge sword, in my case I knew about this before but this also means that you brain can(and will) deteriorate when not used (just like muscles and going to gym again! :p) so its not only to become smarter is to mantain you there.
            <br>Thats when we fall back to habits, and its currently what I am working on as well, still baby steps!!

            <br>Growth Mindset is the state when you have embraced that you are able to improve tour brain capabilities by hard work, study and practice, insted aof being on a fixed minset of I am as smart as I was born and my habilities are limited by this.
            <br>
            <br>It is important since we need to believe we are able to do something in order to do it, knowing that we can still imrpove and lear removes that mind limiter we tend to put on ourselves.

            This makes me take more seriously this whole area of studying, I have always believed it, but now I think I havent prioritized it as much as I should have, will have to re-evaluate my times and make sure to add more times for reflection since its is when things kind of ground into your brain (thats the closest feeling explanation I get when doing it)</p>
