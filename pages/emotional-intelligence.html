        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="sprint-topic-content">
        <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, evaluate, use, understand, manage and handle emotions.
          The ability to understand when somebody else is feeling sad or angry is an example of emotional intelligence.

          <br>  Word comprehension.
          <br>  Math skills. 
          <br>  Abstract and spatial thinking. 
          <br>  Filter irrelevant information.
          <br>
          <br>EQ developes the next abilities:

        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="sprint-topic-content">
        <p>It helps with self growth and self regulation, our self development as humans, we need to be able to pinpoint and area of improvement if we wish to work on it and grow it. 
         <br> I see it as increasing the understanding the knowledge of ourselves and how do we react to internal and external inputs.
          <br>We are part of a society and we interact with each other, understanding how we affect other and how others affect us ends up in a benefit for all the parties involved, self and others.</p>
