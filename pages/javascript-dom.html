          Imagine HTML as a wooden puppet, just wood no clothes no paint.
<br>CSS would be the paint and clothing of our puppet, now it becomes more entretaining but we still have to move everythign ourselves.
<br>Javascript would be the strings that help us make the puppet move and interact with other things, is what makes the magic of movement (for th epuppet at least bc we have animations in CCS but dont think in the color red for now...)

          <br>The DOM is what ties everything together! (between CSS, HTML and Javascript at least!)
          <br>Is what allow everything to intercat with each other it all happens inside the DOM, is is like the special glue that binds the wood puppet, with its clothes and strings to make it dance!
          <br>
          <br>Example:
          <br>I interact with the by using it as a point reference to locate everything isnide it, that way I can select the elements that I am interested in modifying or interacting with.

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>- OBJECTS vs ARRAYS  -</p>

      <div class="sprint-topic-content isText">
        <p>
          <br><span class="isBold">OBJECTS</span>
          <br>I see objects as "things" inside our code, things with characteristics saved inside (key: value).
          <br>for objects, these characteristics (saved inside each object) are called properties.
          <br>(Objects can cointain arryas inside them)
          <br>
          <br><span class="isBold">Example:</span>
        </p>
        <section class="isCode">
          <br>let myObject = {
          <br>  key1: 'thisValue',
          <br>  key2: [value-0, value-1,...value-x]
          <br>}
        </section>
        <section class="isText">
          <p>
          <br>The PROPERTIES inside them can be accessed and manipulated by using dot or bracket notation
          <br> 
          <br>myObject.key1 // Output will be: thisValue
          <br>myObject['key1'] // Output will be: thisValue
          <br>
          <br>ARRAYS
          <br>So far we have been using them for storing more information, they are ORDERED collections of information.
          <br>We store multiple values inside a single variable.
          <br>This ones can also be accessed by bracket notation.
          <br>
          <br>Example:
          <br>myArray = [value-0, value-1, ..., value-x]
          <br>
          <br>Accessing it with bracket notation:
          <br>myArray[1] // Output: value-1  (*REMEMBER - We count from cero!) 
          <br>
          <br>In short I would distinguish them by 2 things:
          <br>1. Objects display their information using the (key: value) notation.
          <br>2. Objects represnt things and Arrays represent information (ordered information).

        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>- Lazy is the Way!  -</p>

      <div class="sprint-topic-content isText"> 
        <p>
          <br>Functions allow us to re-use code sections that we need multiple times.
          <br>Instead of copy pasting every single time, we can define a process (instructions), and put them inside a function, then whenever we need to use the function we can call it.
                  <br>
          <br>We also need to define what type of function will it be, if it requires parameters as inputs and if it retunrs anything after.
                  <br>
          <br>Example:
                  <br>
          <br>function myFunctionName('parametersIfRequired, SeparateThemUsingCommas) {
          <br>  Intructions to perform
          <br>  ....
          <br>  (loops, operations, calls to other functions etc...)
          <br>  if (My function returns anything?) {
          <br>    return (Whatever is returning)
          <br>  } 
          <br>}
          <br>
          <br>Free wording:
          <br>
          <br>You can imagine functions as helpers.
          <br>Instead of waking up, grinding coffee, brewing, serving it, then drinking it.
          <br>Think of a function as if you build a coffee maker that will grind the required amount of coffee brew it and put in your mug for you.
          <br>You build it one and then you can re-use it every morning!
          <br>
          <br>In programming lazy is good be lazy, make as many functions required so you dont have to do all the tedius work of writing and writing again!
